To be clear, the journal is the same content and information that is available for free on this site. You can work through the Happier and Healthier You behavior change process, by following the steps on the '[Start Here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link start.md %})' page.

The journal was created because some people like to have a little more structure around the daily activities. They appreciate check boxes to mark off and blanks to fill in.

The journal also allows you the ability to print out the content, without having to copy/paste from the website (which you are welcome to do) and format on your own. We are simply trying to make it even easier to get started.

If you would like to download a free sample of the journal, you can do so here:

We are limiting the initial sale to **25 individuals**, so we can get a group of people started on the program and added to the Facebook Group. If you would like to be notified when the journal is put up for sale, *[Sign up to get emailed updates](http://eepurl.com/c5qLKv)* or [Download the Sample](https://gumroad.com/l/NaUUw). We will email you prior to posting the link on the website.

Good luck on your journey to a happier and healthier you!
