The journal is the same content and information that is available for free on this site. You can work through the Happier and Healthier You behavior change process, by following the steps on the '[Start Here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link start.md %})' page.

The journal was created because some people like to have a little more structure around the daily activities. They appreciate check boxes to mark off and blanks to fill in.

The journal also allows you to print out the content, without having to copy/paste from the website (which you are welcome to do) and format on your own. We are simply trying to make it even easier to get started.

With the purchase of the journal, we will add you to the __private Happier and Healthier You Facebook Group__. Finding social support is the focus of week seven, however we want to provide a quick and easy way for you find positive support that is empathetic, candid and selfless.

We are limiting the initial sale to **25 individuals**, so we can get a group of people successfully started on the program and added to the Facebook Group.

Good luck on your journey to a happier and healthier you!
