**Comments:**
* Your daily routine is likely becoming a normal part of your life. By keeping the changes simple, small and achievable you have been able to successfully insert new behaviors into your day. These small changes help establish the foundation for your new lifestyle, but to reach your stretch goal, you need to see these behaviors grow into even bigger lifestyle changes. Over the next five weeks, you will develop a pattern of evaluating and expanding your changes every other week. As you make changes to your daily routine, remember that each change needs to be completed in a small and sustainable manner. Be consistent and continue to plan deeper roots for a happier and healthier you.
