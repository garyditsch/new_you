**Objectives:**
* Practice your daily routine

**Comments:**
* At this point, you are a month into your behavior change program. While there it may not seem like you’ve made major changes, because there was no all-or-nothing changes, look at what you have accomplished. You have established three new behaviors that are a foundation for building a new lifestyle. The daily habit was a way to get you started. It was a way to establish success early in your program, helping to build confidence in yourself each day you completed it. The mantra or visualization practice is developing a toolset you can rely on, when things are not simple, easy or positive. Finally, the last activity you’ve added is the daily practice behavior. It is something that continues to build your confidence, as you take action each day, knowing that you are taking steps to be happier and healthier.
